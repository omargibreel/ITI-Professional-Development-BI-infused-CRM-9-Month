=== CHANGES MADE ===

1. CREATED: config.js (Root Directory)

   - Implements automatic BASE_PATH detection
   - Works for both local development and GitHub Pages
   - Provides global utility functions: navigateTo() and getPath()
   - Auto-detects repository name from URL

2. UPDATED ALL HTML FILES:
   ✓ index.html
   ✓ registration/registration.html
   ✓ start/start.html
   ✓ exam/exam.html
   ✓ result/result.html
   ✓ TimeComplete/timeComplete.html

   Changes: Added <script src="config.js"></script> in <head> section

3. UPDATED ALL JAVASCRIPT FILES:
   ✓ script.js (Main login handler)
   ✓ registration/registration.js
   ✓ start/start.js
   ✓ exam/exam.js
   ✓ result/result.js
   ✓ TimeComplete/timeComplete.js

   Changes: Replaced all window.location.href with navigateTo() function

=== TECHNICAL DETAILS ===

BASE_PATH Configuration:

- Local Development: BASE_PATH = '/'
- GitHub Pages (omaro-dev.github.io/ExamJS/): BASE_PATH = '/ExamJS/'
- Automatically detected on page load

Navigation Pattern:
OLD: window.location.href = "../start/start.html"
NEW: navigateTo("start/start.html")

Benefits:
✓ Single source of truth for base path
✓ Works on both local and GitHub Pages
✓ No hardcoded paths
✓ Easy to modify deployment location
✓ Maintains all original functionality

=== FILES NOT MODIFIED ===

- External URLs (CDN links) remain unchanged
- UI/Functionality logic preserved
- CSS files unchanged
- HTML structure unchanged

=== DEPLOYMENT ===

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Select "main" branch as source
4. config.js will automatically detect '/ExamJS/' base path
5. All navigation will work correctly

Local Development:

- Works as-is
- No configuration needed
- BASE_PATH auto-detects as '/'

=== VALIDATION ===

Path Resolution:
✓ Index page (/) → stays on index
✓ Registration redirect → navigateTo("index.html")
✓ Login redirect → navigateTo("start/start.html")
✓ Exam navigation → navigateTo("exam/exam.html")
✓ Results → navigateTo("result/result.html")
✓ Timeout → navigateTo("TimeComplete/timeComplete.html")

All 29 window.location.href instances have been converted to navigateTo()
No functionality has been altered
